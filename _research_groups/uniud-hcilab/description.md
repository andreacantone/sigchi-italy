### Main Research Interests
The HCI Lab at the University of Udine was founded in 1998. The main research interest of the team fall in the disciplined design and rigorous evaluation of digital technologies such as virtual reality experiences, video games, mobile apps, persuasive technology, and affective computing systems. The team particularly focuses on systems to train people in facing risky and stressful situations, and to promote positive attitude and behavior change in users, especially in the health and safety domains. The public aviation safety apps created by the lab have received great attention from the public and the media, with a total of 14 million installations as of January 2022. They have also been featured on major TV stations such as Fox News and Discovery Channel as well as major news web sites such as TIME and Popular Mechanics.
