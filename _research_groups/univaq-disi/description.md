### Main Research Interests
KEYWORDS: Information Visualization, Virtual Reality, Gamification, Technology Enhanced Learning, E-Health, Disaster Management, Children-oriented Design, Cognitive Disabilities, Autism Spectrum Disorder

I’m interested in the social impact of Information and Communication Technology, focusing in particular on fragile and vulnerable population groups (children with cognitive disabilities, people with Autism Spectrum Disorder, elderly people, victims of natural disasters). In the last 10 years my research group has been working on Technology Enhanced Learning (TEL) Systems, e-care Systems, Disaster Management Systems, with focus on information visualization, gamified and VR-based TEL approaches, design methodologies oriented to new kinds of product,  new types of users and multidisciplinary design team, founded on approaches that simultaneously assist in practical problem solving and expand scientific knowledge by generating and testing theories (e.g., action research).
