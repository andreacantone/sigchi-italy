### Main Research Interests
We are broadly interested in human-computer interaction. Our team designs, develops, and studies novel sonic interactions, information retrieval systems, and creativity support tools. We are currently focused on developing Human-Centered AI systems that empower human beings in a variety of ubiquitous, social, and collaborative settings. Examples of our work include systems that support brainstorming, exploratory searches, informal conversations among friends, and everyday digital tasks.
