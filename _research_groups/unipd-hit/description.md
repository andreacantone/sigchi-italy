### Main Research Interests
Analysis of user experience and hybrid situations generated by different kinds of tools (advanced computers interfaces, mobile devices, wearable systems, symbiotic technology, vehicles and adaptive assembly lines, etc) to mediate people’s presence and actions in their life place.  Their methodological portfolio includes classical and innovative methods from HCI and cognitive science research, including discourse and text analysis, gesture analysis and systematic video analysis of behavior, eye tracking, physiological measurements, virtual prototyping, ethnographic approaches and other methods that are adapted or newly developed in order to fit the specificities of the prototypes/users/contexts considered.
