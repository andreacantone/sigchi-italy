### Main Research Interests
The lab conducts research in the areas of human computer interaction and information visualisation. 
Our research mission is to create new ways of interaction through technology, to design experiences (UX) for enhancing and improving the human life in different contexts, to foster access to and understanding of the information through advanced systems of representations and interaction with data.
Our main goal is to study and understand user needs so as to design and develop human-computer interactions and information visualizations that are effective, smart and engaging. 
The activity of the lab focuses on a variety of interaction paradigms, including WIMP and touch-based interaction, mixed reality in its different declinations (AR and VR), ubiquitous computing and tangible/physical computing. 
The research activity span across various fields of application, such as environmental sustainability, smart environments, digital humanities, arts and digital education, and it aims at involving, also in a perspective of co-design and inclusion, multiple categories of users  belonging to different age groups, from children to adults.
