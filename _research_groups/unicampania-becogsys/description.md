### Main Research Interests
The Department of Psychology at Università degli studi della Campania "L. Vanvitelli" is national leader in the field of Cognitive Science and had an excellent international reputation thanks to the advanced research activities of its faculty members. Inside the department, the Behavioural Cognitive Systems (BeCogSys) team has a specific expertise in the field of behavioral and emotional analyses for improving life quality and envisaging mathematical models of human stimuli processing and human adaptation dynamics. The team has a high multidisciplinary research interests covering themeson cybernetics, psycholinguistics, information science, neurosciences and cognitive psychology. In particular, the recent investigations are focused on the cross modal analysis of verbal and nonverbal communication features supporting the modeling and the algorithmic implementation of socially believable ICT interfaces and friendly and emotionally colored interactive dialog systems aimed at improving the life quality of the end users. Particular efforts are devoted to investigate on:


Qualitative and quantitative verbal and nonverbal emotional interactional communication features.

Mathematical modeling of human behavior in interaction and human adaptation dynamics.

Behavioural and contextual analysis of human-human and human-machine interactions
