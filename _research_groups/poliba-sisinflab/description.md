### Main Research Interests
My research activity is mainly focused on "Novel Interaction Techniques and Pervasive Systems" in particular applied to the Cultural Heritage domain. Several interactive systems have been developed, such as an m-learning system running on smartphones to support the visit to an archaeological park. Other systems are designed for large interactive displays and, more recently, for exploiting the possibilities offered by the Internet of Things technology. Tools that allow Cultural Heritage experts to create by themselves interactive experiences to be offered to visitors have been created.
I'm also interested in Cybersecurity, in which HCI research plays a significant role.
