## Syllabus 
The course aims to explore the theoretical aspects and the operational methodologies of Interaction Design, the area of design that aims to create interactive technological devices that are coherent with usersâ€™ cognitive characteristics, behaviour, and lived experiences.
During the classes, it will be illustrated: the historical and theoretical foundations of the discipline; the classification and the specific design features of interaction technologies; the strategies for prototyping interactive artefacts; multimodal and multisensory management; the solutions to prevent errors and to guide towards the correct interactional choice; project management; the presentation of results and the interaction with evaluation and redesign methods.
During the classes, topics related to the ergonomic implications of the most advanced technologies, such as artificial intelligence or automation, will be addressed. Different application sectors will be examined, such as the automotive one, the world of personal online devices (smartphones), and the realm of new media and connected objects (e.g. Internet of things).
