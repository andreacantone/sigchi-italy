## Syllabus 
The teaching is part of the teaching activities characterizing the master degree in Computer Science.
The aim of the course is to allow students to master information visualization techniques, in order to allow the creation of a mental model of a given information domain.
During the course the students will be guided to know the different techniques of representation and presentation of information starting from raw data, and to understand how interactivity can contribute significantly to the success of the visualization.
Besides, the students will be guided to get acquainted with a set of web tools for creating different types of visualization.
The acquired knowledge will be used as a starting point to develop skills and competences for the creation of effective representations and presentations of data.
The project work of the course, focused on different domains such as the visualization of environmental, medical or cultural heritage data, will be the fundamental tool for a first exploitation of these skills.
