## Syllabus 
Knowledge and understanding

Tecniques for the description of data and models favouring multimodal interoperability. Design guidelines taking into account the relevance of separating user interface, application processes and data management.

Applying knowledge and understanding

To highlight the influence of perceptive and cognitive processes over possibilities and limits of different multimodal interfaces. To describe the functions of state of art multimodal interfaces. To evaluate strengths and weaknesses of present multimodal interfaces. To propose efficient models for new interfaces exploiting different modalities.

Important note: Proficiency in programming is required to be able to carry out the final project
