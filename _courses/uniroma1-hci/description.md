## Syllabus 
This course concentrates on the fundamentals of human-computer interaction and discusses in detail the concept of usability for interactive systems as well as the user-centered design (UCD) and the development of interactive systems. The various topics will be examined under different perspectives, dealing with theoretical, methodological, technological and application-oriented aspects, looking at them both in the current scenario and in view of future developments. Along the course, the student should acquire theoretical skills, methodologies, and techniques to be applied in a concrete project to be developed following the user-centered design. Recent technologies for interactive artefacts and immersive environments will also be presented.
