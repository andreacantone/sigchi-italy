## Syllabus 

    Information Visualization(IV): Information Visualization (IV): definitions. Data vs. Information. Goals of IV. Information Visualization vs. Scientific Visualization. Issues involved in IV Design. Mapping: principles, visual attributes. Mapping examples. 2D vs. 3D visualizations. Typical IV design problems. A classification of data types: Categorical, Numerical, Topological, Symbolic, Textual Data.
    Techniques for visualizing and interacting with data: Bivariate, Trivariate, Multivariate data: Scatterplots, Mosaic Display, Parallel coordinate plots, Starplot, Chernoff Faces. Hierarchical Axis. Dimensional Stacking. A general model for information visualization systems. A classification of task types: overview, zoom, filter, details-on-demand, relate, history, extract. Dynamic Queries, Alphasliders, The Attribute Explorer. InfoZoom. Demonstration of XMDV software. Pixel-oriented visualizations: screen-filling curves, recursive pattern, circle segments.
    The presentation problem: Overview+Detail techniques. Focus+Context techniques. Distortion-oriented techniques. Table Lens. Perspective Wall. Fish-eye view. An alternative classification of data types: 1-dimensional, 2-dimensional, 3-dimensional, temporal, multi-dimensional, tree, network. Trees: Treemaps, Cone Trees, Camtrees, Star Tree, Hyperbolic Trees. Networks: SeeNet, HierNet, NetMap. Demonstration of Many Eyes software. Temporal data: Lifelines, AsbruView, Paint Strips. Documents: TileBars, document Galaxies, Themescape, Citeseer-Relator, MDS-interactive.
    Case study: IV in Medicine: Visualizing medical data: medical imaging vs. IV. Demonstration of a DICOM interactive visualizer. A gallery of medical IV examples: Interactive Data Exploration of clinical databases, Digital libraries of anatomical images. Visual data mining of Hemodialysis data.

    Perception, Cognition and Human Factors aspects: Visual perception aspects. Neurophysiological basis of visual perception: visual cortex, ventral pathway, dorsal pathway. Colour vision: trichromatic theory, opponent process theory, dual-process theory. Depth and size perception: monocular cues, binocular and oculomotor cues. Perception without awareness. Perceptual organization and Gestalt laws. Uniform connectedness. Contours. Feature, pattern, and object processing. Object recognition theories. Face recognition. Basic facial expressions. Motion recognition. Optic Flow. Bottom-up and top-down visual processing. Visual attention. Eye movement planning. Attention and performance. Focused and divided attention. Perceptual load theory. Visual task analysis. Visual salience in simple task. Visual salience in complex task. Controlled and automatic processes. Navigation in abstract or physical spaces. Improving navigation. Navigation aids.
    Mobile HCI:. Differences between the mobile context and the desktop PC context: device, users, context. Size issues in mobile devices. Interface Elements of Menu-based Mobile Phones. Menu Interfaces in Mobile Phones. Dual tasking. Attentional blink. Perceptual, motor, social and cognitive aspects of mobile interaction. Workload and stress mitigation issues. Cross-modal effects. Eyes-free interfaces. Multimodal Mobile Interfaces. Cross-modal attention.
    Mobile phones:. User Interfaces (UIs) of Mobile Phones. Mobile Product Categories. UI Styles in Mobile Phones. Example: Two-softkey UI vs. Navi-key UI. Usability of different UI Styles. Evolving different UI Styles. Case Study: unexpected reactions to Nokia Ringo. Case Study: the Nokia Navi-roller failure.
