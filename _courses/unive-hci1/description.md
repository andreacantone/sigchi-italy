## Syllabus 
The teaching falls within the training activities characterizing the degree in Computer Science.
The aim of the course is to provide knowledge on the fundamentals of the interaction between man and computer and on the main paradigms that have developed since the advent of interactive systems.
During the course the student will be guided to know the basic methodologies for the design and evaluation of interactive systems, with particular reference to prototyping methodologies, usability heuristics and evaluation methodologies. The student will be guided to learn how these methodologies can be integrated into the phases of the software life cycle.
The acquired knowledge will be used as a starting point to develop skills and competences in the design of usable user interfaces, through a fundamental activity that is the project work of the course, to be designed in groups using the iterative and interactive approach typical of design thinking.
The teaching contributes to the achievement of the educational goals of the Computer Science bachelor degree, in particular for what concerns the capability of designing usable and accessible user interfaces.
