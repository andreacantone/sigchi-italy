## Objectives
### Knowledge and understanding
The course provides the knowledge for understanding and exploiting different technologies for developing user interfaces, starting from the simplest ones (form-based on a single device) to the more complex ones (multi-device, augmented and virtual reality etc.), with examples of different interaction styles and modalities. The student will learn how to prototype them in an effective way, in order to include different techniques into the application at hand. Finally, the course will discuss the software architectures for developing user interfaces their evolution through the user interface history and examples of modern development toolkits.

### Applying knowledge and understanding

The student will be able to engineer and develop advanced user interfaces, integrating different development technologies, managing their complexity and guaranteeing the overall usability. Moreover, s/he will be able to analyse the technical requirements and the development cost for the different interaction styles and modalities. These skills will be consolidated with the final project, consisting in the ideation of an innovative interactive project. Finally, the student will learn how to use his/her knowledge for taking a decision in a project.

### Making judgments
The student will be able to judge autonomously advantages and disadvantages of applying different interaction styles and modalities according to the application at hand. According to this judgment, s/he will be able to take decisions autonomously in both design and implementation.

### Communication

The student will develop an advanced knowledge of the technical language used for describing the development of the user interfaces in human computer interaction, on oral and written, with a particular focus on writing technical documentation in English. The student will be able to explain and discuss interaction problems related to different modalities, confronting with both professionals and not expert people e.g., the different stakeholders involved in involved in the development process.

### Lifelong learning skills

The teaching material consists mostly of scientific literature and technical toolkit documentation. This will help the student in approaching state of the art sources for the discipline in the future.

## Prerequisites

The course requires a basic human computer interaction knowledge (Human Computer Interaction course from the Bachelor Degree) and a good knowledge of programming techniques (Computer Science Bachelor Degree or equivalent).

## Syllabus


1. Introduction: the past, present and future of user interfaces 
2. User Interface Architecture and Toolkits 
3. Information Visualization 
4. Gestural Interaction 
5. Virtual, Augmented, Mixed and Extended Reality 
6. HCI for AI  

## Teaching Methods

The course consists of lectures (24h) and lab sessions (36h). Lectures will discuss the course topics. Students will apply them through a group project, consisting of the ideation, design, implementation, and evaluation of an advanced user interface, using one or more techniques discussed in the course. Students will write a paper describing the interface and they will present it at the end of the course.
High-quality final projects will be submitted as posters or demos in HCI related conferences.

## Verification of learning

For passing the exam the student is required to perform 4 tests:
1. A test on the course topics  (singularly, 20% of the final grade)
2. Develop a project in a small group  (group, 40% of the final grade)
3. A paper on the project in English (group, 20% of the final grade)
4. The project presentation (group, 20% of the final grade)
The grades are individual even for group assignments.

## Teaching Material
The teaching material consists mainly of scientific literature on the different topics, that will be provided to the student through the Moodle platform.
