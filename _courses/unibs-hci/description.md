## Syllabus 
The goal of this course is understanding the role of the user in the design of usable interactive systems. Therefore, the human-computer interaction discipline is introduced, by deepening those aspects that mainly affect the usability of interactive systems. These aspects are at the basis of the techniques for design, development and evaluation presented in this course and which are referred to the so-called "user-centered approach". The course aims at providing the students with further tools, with respect to those already acquired in previous courses, to cope with the design and development of real software applications, both desktop and web-based.
