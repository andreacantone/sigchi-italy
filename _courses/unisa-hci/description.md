## Syllabus 
*Objectives:*

Students will acquire concepts related to the adoption of Human-Computer Interaction and Experience Design techniques for the Internet of Things, also taking into consideration scenarios of Human-Robot Interaction, in domains such as "search and rescue", assistant robotics, educational robotics and entertainment.

*Knowledge and Understanding:*

Students are expected to gain knowledge on
- Human-Computer Interaction and Human-Robot Interaction theories, principles and techniques especially appropriate in the IOT domain
- Smart Interaction Design techniques for smart objects
- issues related to ethics, trust, and acceptance of the Internet of Things technology, with particular attention to the Human-Robot dialogue
- methods to assess persuasive technology and affective interfaces and their impact on User Experience
- the impact that social robots may have on ethical values such as privacy and autonomy.

*Ability to apply knowledge and understanding:*

Students will learn how to
- apply concepts and theories of HCI to design and evaluate connected objects and connected robots in IOT environments
- design and develop affective Human-Robot/Software Interfaces in IOT environments
- apply techniques for assessing the quality of such interfaces.

*Prerequisites:*

Specific technical skills are not required. Basic knowledge about Human-Computer Interaction are to be considered.

*Contents:*

- A multi-layer design model for IOT
- Understanding people and context in User Experience Design
- Human Computer Interfaces and Human Robot Interfaces in IOT environments
- Cross-device interaction and distributed User Experience
- (inter)usability evaluation and ux testing
- Ethical considerations in the studies on the Human-Robot Interaction
- Strategies for emotional and affective interaction. User acceptance and trust
- Multi-modal Human-Robot communication
- Spatial interaction (localization and navigation, socially appropriate positioning, spatial dynamics of starting the interaction, user information on the intent of the robot)
- Non-verbal interaction (look and movement of the eyes, gestures, touch, posture and movement, rhythm and timing of the interaction)
- Verbal interaction (basic principles of speech recognition, detection of voice activity, understanding language in human-robot interaction.)
- Applications of Human-Robot Interaction in the domains of search and rescue, assistive robotics, educational robotics and entertainment
- Practice on prototyping of connected objects and prototyping of Human-Robot affective interfaces for the IOT environment

*Teaching Methods:*

Lessons will take place with the help of multimedia presentations. All arguments will be accompanied by practical exercises and illustration of significant case studies.
Students will be assigned a group project for the design of a Human-Robot Interface for the Internet of Things (2-4 people) through which everybody can deepen the ethical and the practical aspects and experience group dynamics, as they happen in real working settings.
