## Syllabus 
The teaching falls within the core educational activities characterizing the Digital and Public Humanities degree.
During the course the student will be guided to know the fundamental concepts which characterize the creation of a web site and of the user experience and the basic methodologies for their evaluation.
The acquired knowledge will be used as a starting point to develop appropriate design skills.

The first part of the course is focused on the design of navigational web sites, from the initial organization of the information to the delivery of responsive web sites. 
The course will focus on useful content management tools that allow to maintain the responsive approach but at the same time permits to lower the technical difficulties and to add specific functionalities through a moular approach.
The second part of the course widens the view to the design of the user experience, which takes into account the context in which the interaction happens. The course will focus on the methodologies and tools which allow to design a user experience. 
The mobile and the mixed reality paradigms (augmented and virtual reality) and the associated enabling technologies will be considered for exploring a number of case studies which are relevant for the digital humanities. In particular, the access to information related to art exhibitions, museum collections and cultural artifacts such as ancient manuscripts will be considered.
