## Syllabus 
- Basic concepts of HCI: Interaction design, Usability and 
User  eXperience  (UX),  Human-centred  design  (brief 
recall from previous courses) 
-    Human in the Loop in secure systems  
-    Usable  security:  password,  (biometric)  authentication, 
security devices, warning messages  
-    Usable privacy: access control and policy configuration  
-    Design of user interfaces for secure systems  
-    Principles, guidelines, heuristics and patterns for usable 
security  
-    Evaluation of usable privacy and usable security  
-    Analysis of qualitative and quantitative data  
-    Privacy and Anonymity Tools  
-    Visualizations for Security  
Practice session 
Exercise and discussions on: 
Design  and  evaluation  of  prototypes  and/or  interactive 
systems, user studies; 
Application of statistical methods in use studies; 
Interaction with intelligent systems.
